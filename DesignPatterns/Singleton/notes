Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance,
while providing a global access point to this instance.


Implementation
All implementations of the Singleton have these two steps in common:

Make the default constructor private, to prevent other objects from using the new operator with the Singleton class.
Create a static creation method that acts as a constructor. Under the hood, this method calls the private constructor
to create an object and saves it in a static field. All following calls to this method return the cached object.
If your code has access to the Singleton class, then it’s able to call the Singleton’s static method. So whenever
that method is called, the same object is always returned.


Applicability

Use the Singleton pattern when a class in your program should have just a single instance available to all clients;
for example, a single database object shared by different parts of the program.
